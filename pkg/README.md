A starter Python interpreter written in Rust. This is intended as a learning exercise which could evetually become a drop-in replacement for `python`, but it is not there yet. Think LLVM but exponentially less useful.

## Overview
`memphis` contains a few execution modes, each for learning about a different aspect of interpreter/compiler development:
1. treewalk (default): farthest along in development.
1. bytecode VM: foundation complete, but missing many Python features.
1. LLVM JIT compiler: very _very_ early, contains only a single hardcoded example.
 
See [SUPPORTED.md](docs/SUPPORTED.md) for details on specific features.

## Design Goals
- Minimal dependencies. Uses zero dependencies by default, or enable the REPL, or LLVM backend as needed. This means you can run Python code which does not call the stdlib (limiting, I know) through the treewalk interpreter or bytecode VM using no third-party Rust code. I find this kinda neat and worth preserving.
  - `crossterm`: Only needed for REPL support.
  - `inkwell`: Only needed if using the LLVM backend.
- No shortcuts. This is a learning exercise, so try to do things the "right" way, even if it takes a few tries.

## Installation
Installation requires a 2021 edition of `rustc` (version `1.56.0` or higher).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fromscratchcode/memphis
cd memphis
cargo install --path .
```
## Usage
Use `memphis` as if it were `python`/`python3` and provide the path to a Python module.
```bash
memphis examples/test.py

# or run using the bytecode VM (WARNING: many features currently unsupported)
MEMPHIS_ENGINE=bytecode_vm memphis examples/test.py
```
Or launch the REPL (requires a build with the `repl` feature flag).
```bash
> memphis
memphis 0.1.0 REPL (engine: treewalk) (Type 'exit()' to quit)
>>>
```
See [DEVELOPING.md](docs/DEVELOPING.md) for instructions on local development.

## Contributing
Memphis is a personal lab where I explore how Python works under the hood.

The code is open to explore and learn from, but I’m not actively seeking external contributions.
